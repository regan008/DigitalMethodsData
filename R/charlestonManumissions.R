#' Manumissions Data, Charleston District, South Carolina, 1776-1800
#'
#' This database contains all of the manumissions filed in Charleston District
#' from 1776-1800 contained in the Miscellaneous Records section of the South
#' Carolina Department of Archives and History. After 1800, South Carolina
#' changed its manumission laws to require court approval for manumission,
#' causing the paperwork associated with them to be filed elsewhere likely
#' with the no longer extent records of the court of magistrates and
#' freeholders. See \href{https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/34/}
#' {the original repository} for more info.
